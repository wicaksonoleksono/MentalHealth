# Deprecated Services - Cleanup Notice

## 🗑️ Services Replaced by Unified EmotionStorageService

The following services have been **DEPRECATED** and replaced by the unified `emotion_storage.py`:

### ❌ **media_file.py** (DEPRECATED)
- **Old approach**: Database integration with poor file management
- **Issues**: Used old folder structure, no VPS optimization
- **Status**: All functionality moved to `emotion_storage.py`

### ❌ **vps_storage.py** (DEPRECATED) 
- **Old approach**: Good VPS file handling but NO database integration
- **Issues**: Required manual database operations in routes
- **Status**: Best parts merged into `emotion_storage.py`

## ✅ **New Unified Service: emotion_storage.py**

**Combines the BEST of both old services:**

```python
from app.services.emotion_storage import emotion_storage

# One call does EVERYTHING: VPS storage + database record
emotion_data = emotion_storage.save_video(
    session_id=session_id,
    user_id=user_id,
    assessment_type='phq9',
    question_identifier='question_1',
    video_data=file_bytes,
    filename='video.webm',
    metadata={}
)
# Returns: EmotionData database object with file_path already set!
```

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ **VPS optimized storage** (from vps_storage.py)
- ✅ **Database integration** (from media_file.py) 
- ✅ **File compression & cleanup** (enhanced)
- ✅ **One service call** instead of messy dual operations
- ✅ **Transaction safety** (rollback if either storage or DB fails)

## 🧹 **Migration Status:**

### **Routes Updated:**
- ✅ `/patient/capture-emotion-binary` - Uses unified service
- ✅ `/patient/storage-stats` - Uses unified service
- ✅ `/patient/my-files` - Uses unified service  
- ✅ `/patient/session-files` - Uses unified service
- ✅ `/patient/validate-files` - Uses unified service
- ✅ `/admin/storage-management` - Uses unified service
- ✅ `/admin/cleanup-storage` - Uses unified service

### **Old Routes Removed:**
- ❌ `/patient/capture-emotion` - Removed (old base64 JSON approach)

## 📝 **DELETED Services:**

**✅ Successfully removed redundant files:**

```bash
# Old emotion capture services (merged into emotion_storage.py)
❌ app/services/media_file.py          # DELETED
❌ app/services/vps_storage.py         # DELETED

# Old assessment services (merged into assessment.py)  
❌ app/services/assesment.py           # DELETED (patient workflow)
❌ app/services/assessment_data.py     # DELETED (admin/export)

# New unified services:
✅ app/services/emotion_storage.py     # Handles all file operations
✅ app/services/assessment.py          # Handles all assessment operations
```

## 🎯 **Result:**

**Before (Messy):**
```python
# EMOTION CAPTURE: 3 separate operations, error-prone
result = vps_storage.save_video(...)          # Save file
emotion_data = EmotionData(...)               # Create DB record  
db.session.add(emotion_data); db.session.commit()  # Manual SQL

# ASSESSMENT DATA: 2 services with duplicate functions
from app.services.assesment import AssessmentService           # Patient workflow
from app.services.assessment_data import AssessmentDataService  # Admin/export
assessment = AssessmentService.get_assessment_summary(...)     # Duplicate function!
data = AssessmentDataService.get_assessment_summary(...)       # Same function!
```

**After (Clean):**
```python
# EMOTION CAPTURE: 1 clean operation, transaction-safe
emotion_data = emotion_storage.save_video(...)  # Does everything!

# ASSESSMENT: 1 unified service for everything
from app.services.assessment import AssessmentService
assessment = AssessmentService.create_assessment_session(...)  # Patient workflow
data = AssessmentService.get_complete_assessment_data(...)     # Admin/export
summary = AssessmentService.get_assessment_summary(...)       # No more duplicates!
```

**No more cluster fuck!** 🎉

## 📊 **File Count Reduction:**

**Before:** 6 messy services
**After:** 2 clean services  
**Reduction:** 67% fewer files!
